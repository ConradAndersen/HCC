Comments
--------

*	For readers without prior knowledge of statistical analysis, the paper can be hard to read.

*	As inital research on the relationship between aestetics and usability, a diverse group of test participants would have shown if the hypothesis works for different demographics. This is also commented in the discussion section.

*	The paper indicates that some parts of Computer Science and Physiological Research correlate, especially when developing systems for normal users.

*	The paper indicates that prior research may show that there is a relationship between aesthetics and usability, which is concluded to be the right assumption.

Topics for discussion
---------------------

*	Surfacing too much information (POS System Configuration: https://goo.gl/photos/dyHku3cevhTbsUpRA) vs. surfacing too little information for the sake of aesthetics (Hamburger Menu: https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/) + use of Force Touch on iOS devices (When is information hidden behind a force touch? The user has no way of knowing except trying.).

*	Use of aesthetics at the cost of usability can make the user blame them selves instead of the system: "Even then, people tend to blame themselves for the shortcomings of their devices: "If I weren’t so stupid . . . !"" - http://www.fastcodesign.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name

*	Should expected usability precieved by aestetics match the actual usability?

*	How does the aestetics-usability relationship work over a longer time period?

*	When using an online Survey service, some of the data may not actually be true and is unable to be verified.

*	The wide variety of experiences recorded may raise questions about the validity of the test, as some experiences may sound a like but be the same, while others sound like different experiences but actually be the same when told by a number of different people. - This is also acknowledged in the Implications chapter.

Topics for discussion
---------------------

*	How does recently succesful services fulfil needs? (Facebook, MMORPGs (World of Warcraft), Google, etc.) and does any of them actually fulfil the same needs?

*	Why does fulfilment of one need in a particular class of situations inhibits the fulfilment of other needs?
