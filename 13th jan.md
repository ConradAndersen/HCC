## LEARNING FROM NOTES: Organizational Issues in Groupware Implementation ##

*	The paper studies the implementation of the groupware application Notes in a large consulting firm.

*	The study is done by oberservations, office documents, and by inverviewing employees at multiple hierarchial levels.

*	There are no training done when implementing the Notes application, and the cooperation has a focus on (client)billable hours, which results in users trying to fit the new systems within thier current mental model and workflow.

*	At lower levels (consultants) the work environment is very competitive, which results in Notes only being used for personal gains and not for collaborative work. The work environment is less competitive at higher levels and in the IT department, which results in a sigficant increase in collaborative work compared to the consultants.

*	The paper concludes that the implementation of Notes: "... may have proved more valuable for facilitating individual productivity" but that a side-benefit of implementing Notes was that it facilitated a much improved computer network at the firm and enabled access to networked printers.

*	The paper is only the first of series of studies being conducted within Alpha, arguing that the results may change with time.

### Questions ###

*	**One of the papers last week (Exploring the duality between product and organizational architectures: A test of the "mirroring" hypothesis (2012)) explored the idea of products mirroring the organizational structure.**  
	The paper from last week was mainly concerned with the actual code structure, but the paper from this week shows that the implementation of Groupware in a very individualistic most probably did not turn out in the way that it was supposed to; Could this be releated to the structure of the company who build Notes (Lotus) versus the structer of the company implementing Notes (Alpha)?

*	**The study is from 1992.**  
	Do companies with a similar structure still have problems implementing Groupware today? Is it even possible to implment Groupware in an individualistic work environment?

## From The Matrix to a Model of Cooridnated Action (MoCA): A Conceptual Framework of and for CSCW ##

*	The paper is a review of current models for explaining CSCW, and a proposal for a new model the is better at explaining complex work situations.

*	The paper argue that the Matrix Model was not designed for explaining large and complex work structures, which is why they propose a new model.

*	The new model consists of seven dimensions (Synchronicity, Physical Distribution, Scale, Number of Communities of Pracice, Nascence, Planned Permanence, and Turnover). This framework is proposed as a common framework for all works in CSCW.

*	It is argued that the framework should make it possible to compare eg. the use of a waterproof tablet in medicin and at home.

*	The model is used two exmaples to illustrate how it works.

*	It is concluded that CSCW is a design field, and that it suffers from lack of understanding very large and complex sociotechnical systems, it is futher concluded that even if this model will never be used broadly, a new model is need to put into HCI textbooks.

### Questions ###

*	The conclusion notes that CSCW should not be turned in to a pure social science, but they seem to be comparable even at a very low level, how do they differ?

*	Why has the Matrix model been used (Wrongly according to the paper) for so many years?

*	There are no emperical studies done to prove that MoCA works, is this a problem? And should such studies be done before the model is released "in to the wild"?
