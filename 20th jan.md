# Peephole Displays: Pen Interaction on Spatially Aware Handheld Computers (2003) #

*	The paper investigate the use of spatially aware handheld computers to interact with peephole interfaces

*	A peephole interface is a concept where the acutal UI is larger than what is shown on the screen, eg. only showing part of a map at a time.

*	The paper describe three different ways of creating a spatially aware device, which includes using an optical tracker from a mouse, using ultrasonic tracking, and using a device tethered to a modified ball mouse.

*	The optical tracker is only usable while the device is placed on a table, while the other two can be used while holding the device. The ultrasonic device is too slow and unprecice, which is why the modified ball mouse device is used for the study.

*	The paper describe four different tasks which is completed by 24 people, of which half is using a conventional interface first and peephole interface second, and the other half the other way around.

*	The four tasks were one-handed selection and two-handed selection, in which the user had to select ten different names, map viewing, in which the user had to plan a route using a fictional subway map, and drawing, in which the user had to draw a circle. 

*	In experiments one, two, and four users were significantly faster using the peephole interface. In experiment four most (22 of 24) users preferred the peephole interface, drawing larger figures than using the convetional interface.

*	The paper also describes a study using a 3D-implementation, making greater use of the device being able the move in 3D space. For this study a newer device with a higher resolution and color screen is used, while also upgrading the tracking device.

*	The study includes a calendar, which can be navigated by panning the device horizontal for date changes, and vertically for zooming the view from day to month to year. The study also includes a drawing pad whith a clipboard layer, which can be accessed by moving the device vertically, the user can place things in the clipboard layer and use a pen to "push" them back onto the drawing layer.

*	The study was evaluated by hanging the device on a subway map, and asking and observing people who used the device questions about the UX.

### Questions ###

*	The study is from 2003, while devices used today include all of the necessary sensors, there do not seem to be any real world application of this kind of interfacing with applications, why?

*	Devices today use multi-touch screens, which are able to alleviate some of the navigation problems described in the paper, is this the reason why modern devices are not used like described?

*	In one of the first weeks we talked about devices hiding functionality making discovery of said features much harder, the paper describes the use of a clipboard plane; this seems like something most users would be unable to find on their own, even if the layer seems useful, how could the user be helped in finding the layer?

# The Smart Phone: A Ubiquitous Input Device #

*	The paper is a summary of the (at the time) available ways to use mobile devices to interact with computers, which includes, but not limited to, tracking using a camera, using the mobile phone navigation stick, and controlling devices (like playing pong on a building).

*	The paper position a mobile phone as a device which can be used as an input for all kinds of computer tasks.

*	The paper includes serveral graphical guides, that can help designers on which input type to use for their application.

*	It is acknowledged that futher stuides are needed to fill gaps in the design space of input devices.

### Questions ###

*	Devices today are even more ubiqutious in way that they can be used for input (Anything can be shown on the screen), yet we still mostly use mouse and keyboard, why?

*	While we may never use mobile devices as input for PCs, we may use them for IoT (Internet of Things) devices like smart light bulbs, and door locks, are there other areas where mobile devices are used as the primary input device?

*	If mobile devices are going to be used as input for the devices in the previous question, will the input be a conscious (Manual input), subconscious (Set and forget, depending on position and other data from the device), or a mix of both?
